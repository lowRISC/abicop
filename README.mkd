# riscv-calling-conv-model

This project was created with the aim of providing a "golden model" of the
[RISC-V calling
convention](https://github.com/riscv/riscv-elf-psabi-doc/blob/master/riscv-elf.md)
and to hopefully form part of a RISC-V ABI compliance test suite. It is of
course early days, so for now please consider it a prototype.

## Usage

Usage example:

    $ python3
    Python 3.6.0 (default, Jan 16 2017, 12:12:55) 
    [GCC 6.3.1 20170109] on linux
    Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
    >>> from rvcc import *
    >>> m = RVMachine(xlen=32, flen=64)
    >>> m.call([
    ... Int(32),
    ... Float(64),
    ... Struct(Int(8), Array(Float(32), 1)),
    ... Struct(Array(Int(8), 20)),
    ... Int(64),
    ... Int(64),
    ... Int(64)])
    Args:
    arg00: SInt32
    arg01: Float64
    arg02: Struct([SInt8, Pad24, Array(Float32*1, s32, a32)], s64, a32)
